# PyTetris

This implements Tetris in python, which I'm planning to do in the terminal console. I plan on 
using the `blessed` module to do this, which is a module build around `curses` which allows for drawing to the terminal screen. I also plan on using `pydub`, a python sound library for adding sounds to the game. 

As for native libraries, I'm thinking of using quite a few. First, I'll be using the `types` and `enum` libraries in order to help with development, and then I was also thinking of using the `threading` library for making some parts of my code simpler or using the `pickle` library for saving.
